What does it do? The method takes in an integer d given by the user, and, if array data[ ] isn't full, stores said integer into the array's first available space. Right after, it accordingly increases count--the number of elements saved within data[ ]--by one.

It also initializes a local variable fd with a value of 0, and later on, assigns it with a 1 within the if statement.



What is the result? Local variable fd, which equals 1 at the end of the method.
